          The Altar Server's Guild at Franciscan University is looking for men
          who aren't afraid of a higher calling. If you are seeking a way to put
          your faith into action and contribute your strengths to the most
          sacred moment on campus, your place is at the altar.
        </p>
        <h2>The Supreme Gift</h2>
        <p>
          There is no action on earth more significant than the Holy Sacrifice
          of the Mass. To serve at the altar is to step out of the noise of the
          world and into the presence of the Divine. You aren't just assisting a
          priest; you are ministering to The Sacred Mystery. It is a profound
          gift to be the hands and feet that support the liturgy, ensuring that
          every movement reflects the glory of the Eucharist.
        </p>
        <h2>Strength in Reverence</h2>
        <p>
          True reverence isn't passive. It's disciplined. Serving requires a
          focused mind, a steady hand, and a heart set on excellence. It is a
          manly tradition of service that demands reliability, brotherhood, and
          a deep respect for the sacred rituals that have shaped centuries of
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you put on the cassock and surplice, you join a brotherhood of
          men dedicated to the highest form of service. You learn that
          leadership often begins with the humility to serve.
        </p>

            The altar server has a privileged place in liturgical celebrations.
            Those who serve at Mass present themselves to a community. They
            experience from close at hand that Jesus Christ is present and
            active in every liturgy.
